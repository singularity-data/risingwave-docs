Use the `DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW` command to remove a materialized view from the database.

Before you can remove a materialzied view, you must remove all its dependent materialzied views.

DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW [schema_name.]mv_name;
```


## Parameters

|Parameter                  | Description           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|*schema_name*                   |Specify the name of a schema to remove the materialized view in that schema.
