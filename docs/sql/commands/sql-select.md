description: Retrieve data from a table or a materialized view. 
slug: /sql-select
---

Use the `SELECT` command to retrieve rows from a table or materialized view. It returns the rows that satisfy the creteria that you specify with the clauses and conditions in your query.

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] [ * | expression [ AS output_name ] [ , expression [ AS output_name ] ... ] ]
    [ FROM from_item [ , from_item ...] ]
    [ WHERE condition ]
    [ GROUP BY grouping_expression [ , grouping_expression ... ] ]
    [ HAVING condition ]
    [ ORDER BY sort_expression [ ASC | DESC ] [ , ... ] ]
    [ LIMIT count_number ]
    [ OFFSET start [ ROW | ROWS ] ];
```
Where `from_item` can be:
```sql
    table_name  [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias_list ) ] ]
    window_type ( table_name, col_name, interval_expression ) [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias_list ) ] ] 
    ( SELECT ) [ [ AS ] alias [ ( column_alias_list ) ] ] 
    from_item join_type from_item [ ON join_condition ]
```

## Parameters

|Parameter or clause        | Description           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|*expression*               |A column or an expression.|
|*alias*                    |A temporary alternative name for a table or materialized view in a query.|
|*table_name*                    |A table or materialized view.|
|*grouping_expression*      |<p>Values can be:</p><ul><li>Input column names</li><li>Input column expressions without subqueries or correlated columns</li></ul>|
|**ORDER BY** clause        | The default sort order is **ASC**. Nulls options are not supported now. If the sort order is **ASC** or unspecified, nulls will be placed in front of non-null values. If the sort order is **DESC**, nulls will be placed after non-null values. This is different from the sort logic in PostgreSQL.|
|*sort_expression*          |<p>Values can be:</p><ul><li>Output column names</li><li>Output column ordinal numbers</li><li>Hidden select expressions</li></ul>|
|**LIMIT** clause           | When the ORDER BY clause is not present, the LIMIT clause cannot be used as part of a materialized view. |
|*count_number*                    |The number of results you want to get. |
|**OFFSET** clause          |The OFFSET clause can only be used with the LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses.|
|*(SELECT)*                   |A SELECT command. You must enclose the subquery in parentheses, and specify an alias. When you include a subquery in the FROM clause, the output of the subquery is used as a temporary view that is only valid in the query.|
|*join_type*                |<p>Supported join types:</p> <ul><li>[INNER] JOIN</li><li>LEFT [OUTER] JOIN</li><li>RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN</li><li>FULL [OUTER] JOIN</li></ul><p>Currently, only the ON clause is supported for joins.</p>|
|*join_condition*           |Conditions for the ON clause that must be met before the two from_items can be joined.|
|*window_type*              |The type of the time window function. Possible values are `HOP` and `TUMBLE`.|
|*interval_expression*      |The interval expression, in the format of `INTERVAL '<interval>'`. For example: `INTERVAL '2 MINUTES'`. The standard SQL format, which places time units outside of quotation marks (for example, `INTERVAL '2' MINUTE`), is also supported. |

## Example
Below are the tables within the same schema that we will be writing queries from. 

The table `taxi_trips` includes the columns `id`, `distance`, and `duration`, where `id` identifies each unique trip.
```sql
{
  "id": VARCHAR,
  "distance": DOUBLE PRECISION,
  "duration": DOUBLE PRECISION
}
```

The table `taxi` includes the columns `taxi_id` and `trip_id`, where `trip_id` and `id` in `taxi_trips` are matching fields.
```sql
{
  "taxi_id": VARCHAR,
  "trip_id": VARCHAR,
}
```

The table `company` includes the columns `company_id` and `taxi_id`, where `taxi_id` and `taxi_id` in `taxi` are matching fields. 
```sql
{
  "company_id": VARCHAR,
  "taxi_id": VARCHAR,
}
```

The following query selects the total distance and duration for each taxi from the company "Yellow Taxi".
```sql
SELECT 
    taxi.taxi_id, 
    sum(trips.distance) as total_distance, 
    sum(trips.duration) as total_duration
FROM taxi_trips as trips
LEFT JOIN taxi ON trips.id = taxi.trip_id
WHERE taxi_id IN
    (SELECT taxi_id
    FROM company_id
    WHERE company_id = 'Yellow Taxi')
GROUP BY taxi_id
ORDER BY total_distance, total_duration;
```
